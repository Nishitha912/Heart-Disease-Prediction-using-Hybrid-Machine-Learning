# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning
Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular 
disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data 
analysis. It is difficult to identify heart disease because of 
several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and 
many other factors. Various techniques in data mining and 
neural networks have been employed to find out the 
severity of heart disease among humans. This project 
proposes a hybrid machine learning model using a linear 
model and random forest model, for cardiovascular disease 
analysis, i.e., heart disease prediction.
